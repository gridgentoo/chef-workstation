# What is this script?
#
# Chef Workstation uses a workflow tool called Expeditor to manage version bumps,
# changelogs and releases. When a dependency of chef is released, expeditor is
# triggered against this repository to run this script. It bumps our gem lock files
# and opens a PR. That way humans can do hard work and bots can open gem bump PRs.
